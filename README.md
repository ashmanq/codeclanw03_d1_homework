# SQL - Basics
An SQL script demonstrating the ability to access information from an SQL database by accessing various information from
a Marvel movie database.

The script demonstrates the following:

* Return ALL the data in the ‘movies’ table.
* Return ONLY the name column from the ‘people’ table
* Someone spelled Krusty The Clown’s name wrong! Change it to reflect the proper spelling (Crusty should be Krusty).
* Return ONLY Homer Simpson’s name from the ‘people’ table.
* The cinema is showing ‘Batman Begins’, but Batman is DC, not Marvel! Delete the entry from the ‘movies’ table.
* Add Bart Simpson to the ‘people’ table
* Remove Eric Cartman from the table of people.
* The cinema has just heard that they will be holding an exclusive midnight showing of ‘Avengers: Infinity War’!! Create a new entry in the ‘movies’ table to reflect this.
* The cinema would like to make the Iron Man movies a triple billing. Find out the show time of “Iron Man 2” and set the show time of “Iron Man 3” to start two hours later.
